Up later than usual.

Got up feeling a bit off colour. Patients remarked on my frailness. Seasick 10:50.

Hospital is very full. A lot of work. Given charge of Isolation. Made changes.

Talk of a 3rd stripe so that I can meal at Sargent's Mess.

Not at all well tonight.

[later]

Quite a stir as to reason of date (Antipodes).

Plenty of general work.

Wondering how all are at home especially Clare.

Very poorly all day but kept about.
