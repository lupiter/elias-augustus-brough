    Psalm 84-1 "How amiable /are
    thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts?"
    This was a busy + exciting day
    Long grey lines could be seen
    along the horizon, now + then
    a small island would be passed
    with occasional fishing smacks sailing
    past + soon in the distance an
    outline of South America also of
    North America could be seen.
    As we neared the long looked for
    Panama. At the entrance we passed
    a small Island
    + was soon met by
    the American Pilot who in his
    fast going motor boat span
    round us before + behind
    Soon he was aboard + took

A small sketch presumably of the island

    charge of the boat
    we were informed that we
    would not pass through
    till the morrow as the trip
    takes from 8-12 hours.
    As we neared the mouth of
    the canal I was very much
    struck with the uncommon
    yet beautiful green of the
    vegetation.
    Long before this we had seen
    the glimmer of the lighthouse
    which stood out on the first point

Hand-drawn map showing South America, Mexico, Panama, Tolagedo and the path of the ship, Aeneas.

    to the right of this point
    tucked snugly
    away in the breasts of
    the surrounding hills
    which were covered
    with a brilliant verdure
    of green grass + tropical
    vegetation lay veritable
    fairy town called
    "Tolagedo". This town
    is said to be used as a
    'German Internment Camp'
    I felt half envious of
    men who could be interned
    under such beautiful
    conditions.
    Directly opposite on
    Starboard side but more 
    to the north lay the

    City of Panama.
    As a hill came between 
    us and Panama we did
    not see a great deal of
    that famous city.
    It appeared to be a fair
    size bigger than Hobart
    + nicely laid out. Trams,
    trains + motors beside
    a few donkeys + mules were
    the chief means of
    conveyance but we did
    not see these things until
    the 26th as we had to
    lie outside until the morning.
    You may be sure all
    were about early the
    next morning as all

    were anxious to see
    what they could of this
    World renowned canal.
    Even the sweet sleeps
    of this humble were
    intruded upon + he too
    was out to see what
    was going on.
    Unfortunately the Ward
    was pretty full of patients
    some of whom were
    pretty sick.
    About 7am the anchor was pulled up
    and we began to ascend
    the mouth of the Canal
    We were soon surrounded
    by the brilliant hills
    + scenery + as the

    banks narrowed we were
    soon conversing with
    the natives.
    Among one of the first
    question asked by our boys
    was. Who won the Melbourne
    cup? The natives looked
    so innocent of racing
    + ignorant of Melbourne
    that this called forth quite
    a laugh of mirth on the
    part of our boys.
    Soon we found ourselves
    within the narrow locks.
    Think what it meant to us
    who had read, thought,
    conversed, pictured + to say
    nothing of the excitation of
    the canal. To be here

    + actually gazing upon
    the object of so much
    previous debate.
    I must give here a very brief
    account as to my observations
    were rather intruded upon
    having duties that could not
    be overlooked.
    (a) Steam was shut off.
    (b) The locks were very narrow.
    (c) Water, on entering the locks 
    was often shallow.
    (d) Boats waited until the 
    water entered the lock
    (e) Locks were quickly filled 
    when flood gates opened.
    (f) The usual depth of water 
    passed on by the flood
    gates were 60-80 ft.

    (g) Parallel to the main locks are 
    'linergery locks' kept in
    case of flood gates bursting
    (h) Flood gates made of solid
    steel.
    (i) Progress of boat through the
    locks depended on six
    steel mules (electric)
    three on either side. One in
    front right and centre.
    (j) At places the locks widened
    + we passed quite a number
    of Yankee boats, steamers and
    Merchantmen.
    k. As we passed each strange
    boat, the strange gave
    three sharp blasts. When
    we had passed them by +
    not till then, did the Aen

    return the Salute by giving
    three blasts in return.
    Opposite the town of Panama
    the people crowded out to
    see us. The Yankee soldiers
    who were there in great
    numbers cheered, conversed
    + exchanged mementos +
    articles of clothing with
    our boys. Here, I regret to
    say that many of the
    badges exchanged by our
    lads were not their own
    property; but that of their
    mates. But such is the
    ease with a mixed crowed.
    It was also apparent that
    some of the boys lost their
    "block" + gave away what

    they could ill afford.
    e.g. One dropped, to a young
    lady who took his eye. This
    wristlet watch. Another in
    his excitement discarded
    his money belt containing
    £2 notes + threw over and
    many of their similar cases could
    be recorded. Of course these
    boys later regretted their
    rash deeds. It's a good thing
    to cultivate self control
    under all circumstances.
    I threw over an A.M.C
    badge but as it bounded
    back into the lock I am
    afraid that no one would
    profit by my liberality.
    As we entered each lock

    the boat would be of
    necessity stationary for
    about 20 minutes or more
    for the water to come in.
    At each stop the people
    came out + on one occasion
    English ladies + gentlemen
    threw aboard apples
    chocolate + papers. Just
    when I thought my luck
    was out a nice box of
    chocolates landed at my
    feet. Great was the rush
    thereupon but your
    'humble' servant secured
    + enjoyed the contents
    with some friends.
    With thanks to the donor.

    The names + sizes of locks.
    These are dealt with in
    Views of Panama already forwarded.
    It would be well to add
    here that the lake in the
    centre was a great asset
    in the construction of this
    mighty piece of Workmanship.
    It is of a pretty big extent
    though, I think that the
    canal itself has added
    to the waters thereof.
    The landslip which contrib-
    uted so much to the labour
    + delay in opening the
    Canal was of huge
    dimensions + workmen
    are still engaged along

    the banks securing it
    from further slides.
    The site of the old canal
    also came into view +
    showed the failure of the
    previous Engineer in
    choosing his course.
    The continuous work of
    inundation + filtering of
    sediment by the outflow
    of streams + rivulets
    add to the great upkeep
    of the canal.

    The Position of Panama.
    As can be readily seen
    from the Map: Panama
    seems to be the spot
    which the "Designer" of
    the Universe would have
    in mind for the cutting
    which would unite
    the pathways of Europe
    to Australia by so many
    thousand of miles.
    Many thousands of lives
    were lost in this under-
    taking as is well known,
    by the fatal Malaria.
    Many millions of gallons
    of Paraffin were sprayed
    on the surrounding
    district before the

    deadly disease had been
    sufficiently combated.
    Its origins is not now
    disputed + the deadly
    mosquito's life is in
    jeopardy.
    I have mentioned the
    luxuriant tropical
    vegetations. I will now
    mention a tropical
    shower.
    Although the sun rose
    in beautiful lustre, de-
    picting a hot day yet
    we noticed that the
    people, both black + white
    carried umbrellas + this
    peculiar incident called
    forth many mirthful

    laughs + jests.
    e.g. Say, Darkie, are you
    afraid of the sun tanning
    your face?
    Why do you carry these big
    palm umbrellas + not use
    them, they are clumsy walk-
    ing sticks?
    Ere the afternoon was
    spent we found that our
    wisdom lacked
    knowledge and their
    folly proved wisdom.
    About 2.pm. I ran up
    on deck to recover some
    orderly whose inquisitiveness
    had overcome him + consequence
    by he had eloped.
    The sun was pouring forth

    his rays from a cloudless
    yet sultry sky when
    suddenly the eyes of the
    landsmen turned upward
    + almost immediately
    the huge cumbersome
    umbrellas were also turned
    up, simultaneously great
    drops began to fall and
    before we could take
    cover we were all drenched
    through to the skin.
    The like of these drops +
    the mode of their falling
    could only be pictured
    from an Australian
    thunderstorm which appears
    without clouds.
    I made down for my

    cabin + having only two
    uniforms aboard reluctantly
    clad my self in my "Sunday
    go-Meeting attire" a
    circumstance which I was
    to very sorely regret before
    the night was out.
    Naturally many cases of colds
    + more than one pneumonia
    were the results of the Tropical
    shower yet we were
    thankful there were not
    more.
    The People of Panama.
    I cannot let my notes on this
    wonderful place conclude
    without a few notes on the
    people
    On coming among the U.S.A.

    soldiers + the people one of our own boys
    is trying to be observed shouted "What do
    you think of Australian soldiers _here_?"
    I am glad that the ignorance displayed by
    this boy in trying to count favour for
    Australians in this way was quickly suppressed
    + such taunts arose from our boys that
    he ought never to be heard again on a
    voyage. The white people evidently do no
    work, the labour is black. Whites look
    delicate, dreadfully so. Most have the
    Yankee twang. The Niggers were
    most enthusiastic in their welcome +
    good wishes. Many asking us to give the
    Germans no quarter until they were
    completely beaten. All of their Women with
    huge families became every excited +
    gave vent to their feelings by shouting,
    raising hands above their heads + swaying
    from side to side. "Continued see Heading Below"
