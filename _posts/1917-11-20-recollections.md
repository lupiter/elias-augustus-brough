    Psalm 86-1
    "Bow down thine ear O Lord,
    hear me: for I am poor + needy."
    My daily notes ceased on the
    17/11/17 owing to pressure of
    work, inconvenient time for
    note making, being confined
    most of the time to the
    Ward from which I derived
    great pleasure through very
    little excitement.
    That is nearly a month ago
    + after relying on a few
    specific notes such as date of
    passing Panama etc. I must
    fall back on memory for
    the writing up of the principal
    experiences on the 'Aeneas'

    From the 7th onward there
    was a good deal of excitement
    due to preparing + having the
    Ship's sports. Off course I was
    on the outside of all this excepting
    that it was necessary to
    continually have a man on duty
    to treat wounds occurring during
    these notorious sports. At meal
    times, at night, during duty hrs
    there was the constant call
    for attention to a sprained knee,
    a barked shin, nose, black eye
    langed cheeks, strained sinews
    in back, legs, arms, wrists
    anywhere, everywhere that it
    was possible to get hurt,
    but + bruised heads were indeed
    a speciality to say nothing of

    rendering 1st aid to a knocked
    out man. They called it
    fun but when a man has
    fought so often, so long +
    so hard that he is bereft
    of the "light of day" the skin
    from his face, knuckles
    shins, + feet, to say nothing
    of the bruises about head +
    + body then I consider it
    is no longer fun, but brutal
    determination.
    Such is the picture of one
    whose photographs one of my
    orderlies took outside hospital
    A living monument of the
    old days of the gladiators.
    Yet these say we are more
    civilised to day than they were

    Though so much may be said
    against this form of sport yet
    this is the grim determination that
    has made nations, that has
    made our boys do heroic works
    in face of hardship, peril + death.
    This is the style of determination
    we must + do admire. Without
    it one would be a laggard,
    backless, heartless + powerless
    Thanks for determination + pet
    character, they are the greatest
    assets next to the Grace of God
    for a young man entering thus
    on life.
    "Sports" was the general topic
    day in + day out with little to
    cause an interruption unless it
    was a fire alarm which usually

    took place about 4-30pm Sat
    afternoons. Occasionally rumours
    would tell of a boat being sighted
    but none ever came into view.
    Excitement was caused when a rumour
    said that a German destroyer with
    the disguise of a four masted schooner
    was only three days journey ahead
    + had sunk two American boats.
    This could not have been true though
    Sister Calvin assured me that the
    'Wireless Operator' had told her; but I
    think it was told in order to make
    us careful about lights etc. One
    thing is certain. The route of the
    'Aeneas' was a zigzag + we often
    noted that we were travelling
    a SE course + then due N when
    we should have been going a NE course.

    During all this time the Hos remained
    pretty full. Capt Speirs was a most
    amenable man with whom to work. Spoke
    to me once only saying "no patient should
    go up on deck until after his rest." He
    would do anything for the Hos or the
    patients + I am now sorry that I did
    not utilise more of his amiable nature
    regarding myself + the patients. He said
    that he left me entirely responsible
    for the ward + I felt that + acted
    accordingly. Nevertheless, he was not at
    ease until SSB was disrated + out of
    it. I was glad that my evidence on
    the case tho against him + strictly true,
    did not change his attitude toward 
    me.
    Major Rosenfield though of Jewish birth + of
    peculiar manner proved himself a

    gentleman + friend throughout the
    whole trouble to SSB not only so
    he was extremely good to me, taking
    the 1st opportunity to put me on full
    pay saying "I deserved it" Here I
    was honoured being the only N.C.O of
    the AAMC to receive payment though
    there were quite a lot of NCOs
    made VO
    When I had trouble with the Night
    Steward regarding my night
    orderlies food + I was told by him
    to keep my mouth shut, which often
    I did do so did not fill my orderlies
    mouths, he, the Major hastened to
    my assistance had the Night Steward
    paraded before him + me + the Chief
    Steward told the night Steward that
    I was a "gentleman" + was known to him

    as also said the Chief Steward + that I
    was not to be spoken to like that by him
    or anyone else + that I could have
    whatever I asked for.
    The poor Steward tried to defend
    himself but my evidence was far too
    strong for him as my boys had been
    suffering for weeks through his
    bad temper, due, I believe because
    they did not tip him. yet I felt
    sorry when the Chief would not
    allow him to speak saying it must
    have been serious when the Hos Cpl
    complained + if there was another
    murmur he would know what awaited
    him at the end of voyage.
    The poor night boys who had suffered
    agonies at his hands with beaming
    faces thanked me for the result.

    We still steam ahead the atmosphere
    getting warmer as we approached
    the Equator. At time it was
    fairly warm but not nearly so
    hot as I expected. Many where
    the exclamations + wishes to see land
    only to see Mother Earth once
    more. After 21 days of Sea blue 
    sea, green sea, smooth
    sea. rough sea. quiet + peaceful
    as a mill pond, rough +
    boisterous as Biscay Sea with
    sun shining on it: with moon
    + stars. Stars that we had
    known, dipping to the south
    reminding us of separation
    from home and friends
    Silver sea, sparkling sea.
    dark sea blackness that I could

    almost feel Sea to the front to
    the back below + all round us
    day after day, week after week
    sea eternal sea with nothing
    on the horizon (landscape) save an occasional
    bird + a darting flying fish.
    Horizon, thou teller of falsehood
    have often didst thou seem within
    an hours steam + yet we drew
    no nearer to you, as we crept
    along, so didst thou skip
    away with no object other than
    to deceive our sight.
    Well might early explorers have
    been afraid of you not knowing
    what thou helds't beyond
    that deceiving line. Many
    thought of hobgoblins depths
    of misery, perpendicular heights

    over which one might fall never
    to return.
    Sea, sea, sea;
    So dark and lonesome!
    Speak through the gloom to me
    Of joy and love and home.
    Tell of hearts that are burning
    Of souls that are yearning
    Over the dark sea
    Praying for me.
