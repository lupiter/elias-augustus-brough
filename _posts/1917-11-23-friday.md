    Psalm 100-1:2 Make a joyful noise unto the
    Lord, all ye lands
    Serve the Lord with gladness: come before
    his presence with singing.
    When shall we pass the line
    when shall we cross the Equator? Was
    the question on the lips of many for
    several days prior to the 23rd
    It is the usual procedure on board
    vessels to have sort of "initiation" in
    passing the line. This, in previous
    trips I've taken a somewhat serious
    turn + after having the hose turned
    on you 'ducked' into a bath of cold
    water fully dressed, beladded with sand
    shovels etc etc. you come through the
    ordeal no better for having parsed the
    line but sometimes very much worse.

    Hence it was decided that when
    the "Aineas" crossed the line there
    would be no initiation ceremony.
    I was at work in the ward in the p.m.
    on the 23rd wondering where we
    were + when we should see land
    looking no doubt like a lonely
    sparrow on a clothes line on a snowing
    day when when the Major smiling like
    the rising moon on a frosty night,
    especially at sea, advanced + in
    his tenderest tones asked
    Cpl did you know that we are to
    cross the line this pm? "No Sir. At
    what time are we to pass over? "At
    dinner time probably 5.30pm"
    So at 5.20 pm we crossed the line
    without any ado, no even a cheer, to
    many a mate of sadness for did

    it not mean a leaving of the south
    behind, even the dear old Southern Cross
    that beacon of light known from
    childhood with us familiar memories
        Crossing the Line
        The line is crossed.
    No sound. no stir to tell
        That we are leaving far behind
        The place we love to dwell.
    But into fields anew we go
    With dauntless friends; to face the foe
    Who wronged us, wrenched us
    From our homes, our loves
    And all that we held dear.
        EAB Original
    Having crossed the line we were
    told that a couple of days would bring
    us to sight of land. Early next day
    word came into the ward that

    something was seen on the horizon
    Many guesses were made but
    with my glasses (thanks to Ellendale
    School children) I swept the
    horizon + exclaimed "a schooner!"
    I was right, soon she hove in
    sight her white sails shining
    on the blue ocean as pearls
    shine on a golden background.
    Soon a grey line was seen
    on the horizon again a call
    for the glasses "Land" I declared
    It seemed so high that land was
    improbable but soon it stood out
    + was evidently a rock at least 3000ft,
    appeared like a cloud
    in the distance but
    soon became visible
    we veered to the right
    + left it doing it's sentinel
    work on the Port side.

#### Crossing the Line  
The line is crossed.  
No sound. no stir to tell  
That we are leaving far behind  
The place we love to dwell.  
But into fields anew we go  
With dauntless friends; to face the foe  
Who wronged us, wrenched us  
From our homes, our loves  
And all that we held dear.
