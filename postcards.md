There is no address, instead the message spreads across all the card.


    Dear Clare,
    Just
    Walking home from mtg.
    Going to the trains.
    Going out visiting:
    Sitting by the beach.
    Watching the setting sun.
    Witnessing an unknown picture.
    Sitting on a certain leanback.
    Singing a certain Song.
    Sitting in a lightless room
    Thinking of days to come
    Brooding of loving days to come
    Planning for future frents
    Those dear days which we used to spend together
    Only for you & I always.
    As ever Gus
