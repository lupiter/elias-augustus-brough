<p>Hand-drawn map showing South America, Mexico, Panama, Tolagedo and the path of the ship, Aeneas.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>to the right of this point
tucked snugly
away in the breasts of
the surrounding hills
which were covered
with a brilliant verdure
of green grass + tropical
vegetation lay veritable
fairy town called
"Tolagedo". This town
is said to be used as a
'German Internment Camp'
I felt half envious of
men who could be interned
under such beautiful
conditions.
Directly opposite on
Starboard side but more 
to the north lay the

City of Panama.
As a hill came between 
us and Panama we did
not see a great deal of
that famous city.
It appeared to be a fair
size bigger than Hobart
+ nicely laid out. Trams,
trains + motors beside
a few donkeys + mules were
the chief means of
conveyance but we did
not see these things until
the 26th as we had to
lie outside until the morning.
You may be sure all
were about early the
next morning as all

were anxious to see
what they could of this
World renowned canal.
Even the sweet sleeps
of this humble were
intruded upon + he too
was out to see what
was going on.
Unfortunately the Ward
was pretty full of patients
some of whom were
pretty sick.
About 7am the anchor was pulled up
and we began to ascend
the mouth of the Canal
We were soon surrounded
by the brilliant hills
+ scenery + as the

banks narrowed we were
soon conversing with
the natives.
Among one of the first
question asked by our boys
was. Who won the Melbourne
cup? The natives looked
so innocent of racing
+ ignorant of Melbourne
that this called forth quite
a laugh of mirth on the
part of our boys.
Soon we found ourselves
within the narrow locks.
Think what it meant to us
who had read, thought,
conversed, pictured + to say
nothing of the excitation of
the canal. To be here

+ actually gazing upon
the object of so much
previous debate.
I must give here a very brief
account as to my observations
were rather intruded upon
having duties that could not
be overlooked.
(a) Steam was shut off.
(b) The locks were very narrow.
(c) Water, on entering the locks 
was often shallow.
(d) Boats waited until the 
water entered the lock
(e) Locks were quickly filled 
when flood gates opened.
(f) The usual depth of water 
passed on by the flood
gates were 60-80 ft.

(g) Parallel to the main locks are 
'linergery locks' kept in
case of flood gates bursting
(h) Flood gates made of solid
steel.
(i) Progress of boat through the
locks depended on six
steel mules (electric)
three on either side. One in
front right and centre.
(j) At places the locks widened
+ we passed quite a number
of Yankee boats, steamers and
Merchantmen.
k. As we passed each strange
boat, the strange gave
three sharp blasts. When
we had passed them by +
not till then, did the Aen

return the Salute by giving
three blasts in return.
Opposite the town of Panama
the people crowded out to
see us. The Yankee soldiers
who were there in great
numbers cheered, conversed
+ exchanged mementos +
articles of clothing with
our boys. Here, I regret to
say that many of the
badges exchanged by our
lads were not their own
property; but that of their
mates. But such is the
ease with a mixed crowed.
It was also apparent that
some of the boys lost their
"block" + gave away what

they could ill afford.
e.g. One dropped, to a young
lady who took his eye. This
wristlet watch. Another in
his excitement discarded
his money belt containing
Â£2 notes + threw over and
many of their similar cases could
be recorded. Of course these
boys later regretted their
rash deeds. It's a good thing
to cultivate self control
under all circumstances.
I threw over an A.M.C
badge but as it bounded
back into the lock I am
afraid that no one would
profit by my liberality.
As we entered each lock

the boat would be of
necessity stationary for
about 20 minutes or more
for the water to come in.
At each stop the people
came out + on one occasion
English ladies + gentlemen
threw aboard apples
chocolate + papers. Just
when I thought my luck
was out a nice box of
chocolates landed at my
feet. Great was the rush
thereupon but your
'humble' servant secured
+ enjoyed the contents
with some friends.
With thanks to the donor.

The names + sizes of locks.
These are dealt with in
Views of Panama already forwarded.
It would be well to add
here that the lake in the
centre was a great asset
in the construction of this
mighty piece of Workmanship.
It is of a pretty big extent
though, I think that the
canal itself has added
to the waters thereof.
The landslip which contrib-
uted so much to the labour
+ delay in opening the
Canal was of huge
dimensions + workmen
are still engaged along

the banks securing it
from further slides.
The site of the old canal
also came into view +
showed the failure of the
previous Engineer in
choosing his course.
The continuous work of
inundation + filtering of
sediment by the outflow
of streams + rivulets
add to the great upkeep
of the canal.

The Position of Panama.
As can be readily seen
from the Map: Panama
seems to be the spot
which the "Designer" of
the Universe would have
in mind for the cutting
which would unite
the pathways of Europe
to Australia by so many
thousand of miles.
Many thousands of lives
were lost in this under-
taking as is well known,
by the fatal Malaria.
Many millions of gallons
of Paraffin were sprayed
on the surrounding
district before the

deadly disease had been
sufficiently combated.
Its origins is not now
disputed + the deadly
mosquito's life is in
jeopardy.
I have mentioned the
luxuriant tropical
vegetations. I will now
mention a tropical
shower.
Although the sun rose
in beautiful lustre, de-
picting a hot day yet
we noticed that the
people, both black + white
carried umbrellas + this
peculiar incident called
forth many mirthful

laughs + jests.
e.g. Say, Darkie, are you
afraid of the sun tanning
your face?
Why do you carry these big
palm umbrellas + not use
them, they are clumsy walk-
ing sticks?
Ere the afternoon was
spent we found that our
wisdom lacked
knowledge and their
folly proved wisdom.
About 2.pm. I ran up
on deck to recover some
orderly whose inquisitiveness
had overcome him + consequence
by he had eloped.
The sun was pouring forth

his rays from a cloudless
yet sultry sky when
suddenly the eyes of the
landsmen turned upward
+ almost immediately
the huge cumbersome
umbrellas were also turned
up, simultaneously great
drops began to fall and
before we could take
cover we were all drenched
through to the skin.
The like of these drops +
the mode of their falling
could only be pictured
from an Australian
thunderstorm which appears
without clouds.
I made down for my

cabin + having only two
uniforms aboard reluctantly
clad my self in my "Sunday
go-Meeting attire" a
circumstance which I was
to very sorely regret before
the night was out.
Naturally many cases of colds
+ more than one pneumonia
were the results of the Tropical
shower yet we were
thankful there were not
more.
The People of Panama.
I cannot let my notes on this
wonderful place conclude
without a few notes on the
people
On coming among the U.S.A.

soldiers + the people one of our own boys
is trying to be observed shouted "What do
you think of Australian soldiers _here_?"
I am glad that the ignorance displayed by
this boy in trying to count favour for
Australians in this way was quickly suppressed
+ such taunts arose from our boys that
he ought never to be heard again on a
voyage. The white people evidently do no
work, the labour is black. Whites look
delicate, dreadfully so. Most have the
Yankee twang. The Niggers were
most enthusiastic in their welcome +
good wishes. Many asking us to give the
Germans no quarter until they were
completely beaten. All of their Women with
huge families became every excited +
gave vent to their feelings by shouting,
raising hands above their heads + swaying
from side to side. "Continued see Heading Below"
