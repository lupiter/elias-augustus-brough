Lord, all ye lands
Serve the Lord with gladness: come before
his presence with singing.
When shall we pass the line
when shall we cross the Equator? Was
the question on the lips of many for
several days prior to the 23rd
It is the usual procedure on board
vessels to have sort of "initiation" in
passing the line. This, in previous
trips I've taken a somewhat serious
turn + after having the hose turned
on you 'ducked' into a bath of cold
water fully dressed, beladded with sand
shovels etc etc. you come through the
ordeal no better for having parsed the
line but sometimes very much worse.

Hence it was decided that when
the "Aineas" crossed the line there
would be no initiation ceremony.
I was at work in the ward in the p.m.
on the 23rd wondering where we
were + when we should see land
looking no doubt like a lonely
sparrow on a clothes line on a snowing
day when when the Major smiling like
the rising moon on a frosty night,
especially at sea, advanced + in
his tenderest tones asked
Cpl did you know that we are to
cross the line this pm? "No Sir. At
what time are we to pass over? "At
dinner time probably 5.30pm"
So at 5.20 pm we crossed the line
without any ado, no even a cheer, to
many a mate of sadness for did

it not mean a leaving of the south
behind, even the dear old Southern Cross
that beacon of light known from
childhood with us familiar memories
    Crossing the Line
    The line is crossed.
No sound. no stir to tell
    That we are leaving far behind
    The place we love to dwell.
But into fields anew we go
With dauntless friends; to face the foe
Who wronged us, wrenched us
From our homes, our loves
And all that we held dear.
    EAB Original
Having crossed the line we were
told that a couple of days would bring
us to sight of land. Early next day
word came into the ward that

something was seen on the horizon
Many guesses were made but
with my glasses (thanks to Ellendale
School children) I swept the
horizon + exclaimed "a schooner!"
I was right, soon she hove in
sight her white sails shining
on the blue ocean as pearls
shine on a golden background.
Soon a grey line was seen
on the horizon again a call
for the glasses "Land" I declared
It seemed so high that land was
improbable but soon it stood out
+ was evidently a rock at least 3000ft,
appeared like a cloud
in the distance but
soon became visible
we veered to the right
+ left it doing it's sentinel
work on the Port side.
