The war diary and ephemera of Elias Augustus Brough, Private, 6th Australian Field Ambulance. Transcribed by Cathy Wise, his great-granddaughter.

Please note that these documents are transcribed as written, and they were written by a white Australian in 1917/1918, so there may be language (including racial slurs) that isn't acceptable today.
