&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Psalm 84-1 &quot;How amiable /are

This was a busy + exciting day
Long grey lines could be seen
along the horizon, now + then
a small island would be passed
with occasional fishing smacks sailing
past + soon in the distance an
outline of South America also of
North America could be seen.
As we neared the long looked for
Panama. At the entrance we passed
a small Island
+ was soon met by
the American Pilot who in his
fast going motor boat span
round us before + behind
Soon he was aboard + took
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small sketch presumably of the island&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;charge of the boat
we were informed that we
would not pass through
till the morrow as the trip
takes from 8-12 hours.
As we neared the mouth of
the canal I was very much
struck with the uncommon
yet beautiful green of the
vegetation.
Long before this we had seen
the glimmer of the lighthouse
which stood out on the first point
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hand-drawn map showing South America, Mexico, Panama, Tolagedo and the path of the ship, Aeneas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;to the right of this point
tucked snugly
away in the breasts of
the surrounding hills
which were covered
with a brilliant verdure
of green grass + tropical
vegetation lay veritable
fairy town called
&quot;Tolagedo&quot;. This town
is said to be used as a
'German Internment Camp'
I felt half envious of
men who could be interned
under such beautiful
conditions.
Directly opposite on
Starboard side but more 
to the north lay the

City of Panama.
As a hill came between 
us and Panama we did
not see a great deal of
that famous city.
It appeared to be a fair
size bigger than Hobart
+ nicely laid out. Trams,
trains + motors beside
a few donkeys + mules were
the chief means of
conveyance but we did
not see these things until
the 26th as we had to
lie outside until the morning.
You may be sure all
were about early the
next morning as all

were anxious to see
what they could of this
World renowned canal.
Even the sweet sleeps
of this humble were
intruded upon + he too
was out to see what
was going on.
Unfortunately the Ward
was pretty full of patients
some of whom were
pretty sick.
About 7am the anchor was pulled up
and we began to ascend
the mouth of the Canal
We were soon surrounded
by the brilliant hills
+ scenery + as the

banks narrowed we were
soon conversing with
the natives.
Among one of the first
question asked by our boys
was. Who won the Melbourne
cup? The natives looked
so innocent of racing
+ ignorant of Melbourne
that this called forth quite
a laugh of mirth on the
part of our boys.
Soon we found ourselves
within the narrow locks.
Think what it meant to us
who had read, thought,
conversed, pictured + to say
nothing of the excitation of
the canal. To be here

+ actually gazing upon
the object of so much
previous debate.
I must give here a very brief
account as to my observations
were rather intruded upon
having duties that could not
be overlooked.
(a) Steam was shut off.
(b) The locks were very narrow.
(c) Water, on entering the locks 
was often shallow.
(d) Boats waited until the 
water entered the lock
(e) Locks were quickly filled 
when flood gates opened.
(f) The usual depth of water 
passed on by the flood
gates were 60-80 ft.

(g) Parallel to the main locks are 
'linergery locks' kept in
case of flood gates bursting
(h) Flood gates made of solid
steel.
(i) Progress of boat through the
locks depended on six
steel mules (electric)
three on either side. One in
front right and centre.
(j) At places the locks widened
+ we passed quite a number
of Yankee boats, steamers and
Merchantmen.
k. As we passed each strange
boat, the strange gave
three sharp blasts. When
we had passed them by +
not till then, did the Aen

return the Salute by giving
three blasts in return.
Opposite the town of Panama
the people crowded out to
see us. The Yankee soldiers
who were there in great
numbers cheered, conversed
+ exchanged mementos +
articles of clothing with
our boys. Here, I regret to
say that many of the
badges exchanged by our
lads were not their own
property; but that of their
mates. But such is the
ease with a mixed crowed.
It was also apparent that
some of the boys lost their
&quot;block&quot; + gave away what

they could ill afford.
e.g. One dropped, to a young
lady who took his eye. This
wristlet watch. Another in
his excitement discarded
his money belt containing
Â£2 notes + threw over and
many of their similar cases could
be recorded. Of course these
boys later regretted their
rash deeds. It's a good thing
to cultivate self control
under all circumstances.
I threw over an A.M.C
badge but as it bounded
back into the lock I am
afraid that no one would
profit by my liberality.
As we entered each lock

the boat would be of
necessity stationary for
about 20 minutes or more
for the water to come in.
At each stop the people
came out + on one occasion
English ladies + gentlemen
threw aboard apples
chocolate + papers. Just
when I thought my luck
was out a nice box of
chocolates landed at my
feet. Great was the rush
thereupon but your
'humble' servant secured
+ enjoyed the contents
with some friends.
With thanks to the donor.

The names + sizes of locks.
These are dealt with in
Views of Panama already forwarded.
It would be well to add
here that the lake in the
centre was a great asset
in the construction of this
mighty piece of Workmanship.
It is of a pretty big extent
though, I think that the
canal itself has added
to the waters thereof.
The landslip which contrib-
uted so much to the labour
+ delay in opening the
Canal was of huge
dimensions + workmen
are still engaged along

the banks securing it
from further slides.
The site of the old canal
also came into view +
showed the failure of the
previous Engineer in
choosing his course.
The continuous work of
inundation + filtering of
sediment by the outflow
of streams + rivulets
add to the great upkeep
of the canal.

The Position of Panama.
As can be readily seen
from the Map: Panama
seems to be the spot
which the &quot;Designer&quot; of
the Universe would have
in mind for the cutting
which would unite
the pathways of Europe
to Australia by so many
thousand of miles.
Many thousands of lives
were lost in this under-
taking as is well known,
by the fatal Malaria.
Many millions of gallons
of Paraffin were sprayed
on the surrounding
district before the

deadly disease had been
sufficiently combated.
Its origins is not now
disputed + the deadly
mosquito's life is in
jeopardy.
I have mentioned the
luxuriant tropical
vegetations. I will now
mention a tropical
shower.
Although the sun rose
in beautiful lustre, de-
picting a hot day yet
we noticed that the
people, both black + white
carried umbrellas + this
peculiar incident called
forth many mirthful

laughs + jests.
e.g. Say, Darkie, are you
afraid of the sun tanning
your face?
Why do you carry these big
palm umbrellas + not use
them, they are clumsy walk-
ing sticks?
Ere the afternoon was
spent we found that our
wisdom lacked
knowledge and their
folly proved wisdom.
About 2.pm. I ran up
on deck to recover some
orderly whose inquisitiveness
had overcome him + consequence
by he had eloped.
The sun was pouring forth

his rays from a cloudless
yet sultry sky when
suddenly the eyes of the
landsmen turned upward
+ almost immediately
the huge cumbersome
umbrellas were also turned
up, simultaneously great
drops began to fall and
before we could take
cover we were all drenched
through to the skin.
The like of these drops +
the mode of their falling
could only be pictured
from an Australian
thunderstorm which appears
without clouds.
I made down for my

cabin + having only two
uniforms aboard reluctantly
clad my self in my &quot;Sunday
go-Meeting attire&quot; a
circumstance which I was
to very sorely regret before
the night was out.
Naturally many cases of colds
+ more than one pneumonia
were the results of the Tropical
shower yet we were
thankful there were not
more.
The People of Panama.
I cannot let my notes on this
wonderful place conclude
without a few notes on the
people
On coming among the U.S.A.

soldiers + the people one of our own boys
is trying to be observed shouted &quot;What do
you think of Australian soldiers _here_?&quot;
I am glad that the ignorance displayed by
this boy in trying to count favour for
Australians in this way was quickly suppressed
+ such taunts arose from our boys that
he ought never to be heard again on a
voyage. The white people evidently do no
work, the labour is black. Whites look
delicate, dreadfully so. Most have the
Yankee twang. The Niggers were
most enthusiastic in their welcome +
good wishes. Many asking us to give the
Germans no quarter until they were
completely beaten. All of their Women with
huge families became every excited +
gave vent to their feelings by shouting,
raising hands above their heads + swaying
from side to side. &quot;Continued see Heading Below&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanded&quot;&gt;Expanded&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts?&lt;/p&gt;

No sound. no stir to tell

Having crossed the line we were
told that a couple of days would bring
us to sight of land. Early next day
word came into the ward that

something was seen on the horizon
Many guesses were made but
with my glasses (thanks to Ellendale
School children) I swept the
horizon + exclaimed &quot;a schooner!&quot;
I was right, soon she hove in
sight her white sails shining
on the blue ocean as pearls
shine on a golden background.
Soon a grey line was seen
on the horizon again a call
for the glasses &quot;Land&quot; I declared
It seemed so high that land was
improbable but soon it stood out
+ was evidently a rock at least 3000ft,
appeared like a cloud
in the distance but
soon became visible
we veered to the right
+ left it doing it's sentinel
work on the Port side.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Psalm 86-1
&quot;Bow down thine ear O Lord,
hear me: for I am poor + needy.&quot;
My daily notes ceased on the
17/11/17 owing to pressure of
work, inconvenient time for
note making, being confined
most of the time to the
Ward from which I derived
great pleasure through very
little excitement.
That is nearly a month ago
+ after relying on a few
specific notes such as date of
passing Panama etc. I must
fall back on memory for
the writing up of the principal
experiences on the 'Aeneas'

From the 7th onward there
was a good deal of excitement
due to preparing + having the
Ship's sports. Off course I was
on the outside of all this excepting
that it was necessary to
continually have a man on duty
to treat wounds occurring during
these notorious sports. At meal
times, at night, during duty hrs
there was the constant call
for attention to a sprained knee,
a barked shin, nose, black eye
langed cheeks, strained sinews
in back, legs, arms, wrists
anywhere, everywhere that it
was possible to get hurt,
but + bruised heads were indeed
a speciality to say nothing of

rendering 1st aid to a knocked
out man. They called it
fun but when a man has
fought so often, so long +
so hard that he is bereft
of the &quot;light of day&quot; the skin
from his face, knuckles
shins, + feet, to say nothing
of the bruises about head +
+ body then I consider it
is no longer fun, but brutal
determination.
Such is the picture of one
whose photographs one of my
orderlies took outside hospital
A living monument of the
old days of the gladiators.
Yet these say we are more
civilised to day than they were

Though so much may be said
against this form of sport yet
this is the grim determination that
has made nations, that has
made our boys do heroic works
in face of hardship, peril + death.
This is the style of determination
we must + do admire. Without
it one would be a laggard,
backless, heartless + powerless
Thanks for determination + pet
character, they are the greatest
assets next to the Grace of God
for a young man entering thus
on life.
&quot;Sports&quot; was the general topic
day in + day out with little to
cause an interruption unless it
was a fire alarm which usually

took place about 4-30pm Sat
afternoons. Occasionally rumours
would tell of a boat being sighted
but none ever came into view.
Excitement was caused when a rumour
said that a German destroyer with
the disguise of a four masted schooner
was only three days journey ahead
+ had sunk two American boats.
This could not have been true though
Sister Calvin assured me that the
'Wireless Operator' had told her; but I
think it was told in order to make
us careful about lights etc. One
thing is certain. The route of the
'Aeneas' was a zigzag + we often
noted that we were travelling
a SE course + then due N when
we should have been going a NE course.

During all this time the Hos remained
pretty full. Capt Speirs was a most
amenable man with whom to work. Spoke
to me once only saying &quot;no patient should
go up on deck until after his rest.&quot; He
would do anything for the Hos or the
patients + I am now sorry that I did
not utilise more of his amiable nature
regarding myself + the patients. He said
that he left me entirely responsible
for the ward + I felt that + acted
accordingly. Nevertheless, he was not at
ease until SSB was disrated + out of
it. I was glad that my evidence on
the case tho against him + strictly true,
did not change his attitude toward 
me.
Major Rosenfield though of Jewish birth + of
peculiar manner proved himself a

gentleman + friend throughout the
whole trouble to SSB not only so
he was extremely good to me, taking
the 1st opportunity to put me on full
pay saying &quot;I deserved it&quot; Here I
was honoured being the only N.C.O of
the AAMC to receive payment though
there were quite a lot of NCOs
made VO
When I had trouble with the Night
Steward regarding my night
orderlies food + I was told by him
to keep my mouth shut, which often
I did do so did not fill my orderlies
mouths, he, the Major hastened to
my assistance had the Night Steward
paraded before him + me + the Chief
Steward told the night Steward that
I was a &quot;gentleman&quot; + was known to him

as also said the Chief Steward + that I
was not to be spoken to like that by him
or anyone else + that I could have
whatever I asked for.
The poor Steward tried to defend
himself but my evidence was far too
strong for him as my boys had been
suffering for weeks through his
bad temper, due, I believe because
they did not tip him. yet I felt
sorry when the Chief would not
allow him to speak saying it must
have been serious when the Hos Cpl
complained + if there was another
murmur he would know what awaited
him at the end of voyage.
The poor night boys who had suffered
agonies at his hands with beaming
faces thanked me for the result.

We still steam ahead the atmosphere
getting warmer as we approached
the Equator. At time it was
fairly warm but not nearly so
hot as I expected. Many where
the exclamations + wishes to see land
only to see Mother Earth once
more. After 21 days of Sea blue 
sea, green sea, smooth
sea. rough sea. quiet + peaceful
as a mill pond, rough +
boisterous as Biscay Sea with
sun shining on it: with moon
+ stars. Stars that we had
known, dipping to the south
reminding us of separation
from home and friends
Silver sea, sparkling sea.
dark sea blackness that I could

almost feel Sea to the front to
the back below + all round us
day after day, week after week
sea eternal sea with nothing
on the horizon (landscape) save an occasional
bird + a darting flying fish.
Horizon, thou teller of falsehood
have often didst thou seem within
an hours steam + yet we drew
no nearer to you, as we crept
along, so didst thou skip
away with no object other than
to deceive our sight.
Well might early explorers have
been afraid of you not knowing
what thou helds't beyond
that deceiving line. Many
thought of hobgoblins depths
of misery, perpendicular heights

over which one might fall never
to return.
Sea, sea, sea;
So dark and lonesome!
Speak through the gloom to me
Of joy and love and home.
Tell of hearts that are burning
Of souls that are yearning
Over the dark sea
Praying for me.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanded&quot;&gt;Expanded&lt;/h3&gt;
